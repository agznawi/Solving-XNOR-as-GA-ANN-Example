# Solving-XNOR-as-GA-ANN-Example
Solving XNOR gate as an example of training artificial neural network with genetic algorithm

This project is based on "Writing Text Using Genetic Algorithm", which I wrote to demonestrate the very basics of genetic algorithm. See it here: https://github.com/AGhaznawi/Writing-Text-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

ANN arcitecture: 3 layers with full interconnection.

XNOR gate:

      A B | O
      ----|--
      0 0 | 1
      0 1 | 0
      1 0 | 0
      1 1 | 1
